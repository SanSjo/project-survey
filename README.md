# Build a survey form using React

This week's project we use React to build a survey form, similar to typeform. The completed project consist of 3 questions  answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

In this project we learned the purpose of state in react and how to use the useState() hook in React within the different input types, and how to connect HTML form inputs to state. And we learned how to use state to show different component based on where you are in the survey. 

This is what we had to include int he project: 
- The survey should consist of at least 3 questions.
- At least one question should use radio buttons.
- At least one question should use a select dropdown.
- There should be a submit button, which when pressed should hide the form and show a summary of the user's submissions.

I also did a stretch goal which was a multi-step form, to show each question in its own 'page' with a continue button to progress to the next question. 

If I would have more time I would have done a progress bar that visualis to the user how far through in the surveythey are. And I would also have done more to the styling.
