# Build a survey form using React

This week's project is to use React to build a survey form, similar to typeform. Your completed project should consist of at least 3 questions which need to be answered by users. When the user presses submit, they should see a summary of their answers.

In this project we learned the purpose of state in react and how to use the useState() hook in React within the different input types, and also how to connect HTML form inputs to state.
